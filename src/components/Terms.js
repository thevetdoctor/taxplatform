        which includes any provision that violates any clearly established legal
        right of a consumer, or responsibility of a seller, as established by
        state or federal law. In addition, under the TCCWNA, no consumer
        contract may state that any of its provisions are or may be void,
        unenforceable or inapplicable in some jurisdictions without specifying
        which provisions are or are not void, unenforceable or inapplicable in

        shall not be applicable to New Jersey residents: <br />
        (1) in the Warranty Disclaimers and Other Disclaimers section, the
        provision(s) concerning limiting ODFS' liability for any loss or damage
        is not applicable to New Jersey residents to the extent ODFS was
        negligent or has breached its obligation to you; <br />
        (2) in the Limitations of Liability section, the provision concerning
        the exclusion or limitation of certain damages is not applicable to New
        Jersey residents with respect to punitive damages, loss of data, and
        loss of or damage to property; and <br />
        (3) also in the Limitations of Liability section, the provision
        concerning the indemnification by you is not applicable to New Jersey
        residents unless you were negligent or have breached these Terms of Use.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        15.CHANGES TO PORTAL AND OFFERINGS ODFS reserves the right at any time
        and from time to time to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or
